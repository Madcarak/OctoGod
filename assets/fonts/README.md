# Font Assets

This directory contains the static font files for Pixelify Sans that are used in native platforms.

For web, we use the `@fontsource-variable/pixelify-sans` package which provides a variable font version.

## Font Files

- PixelifySans-Regular.ttf
- PixelifySans-Medium.ttf
- PixelifySans-SemiBold.ttf
- PixelifySans-Bold.ttf

These files are loaded using the `useFonts` hook from `expo-font` in the root layout.
