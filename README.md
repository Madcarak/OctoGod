# OctoGod

Horizontal game

Summary:
You play as a divine octopus, protector of the oceans, observing humanity's evolution through the ages. Your mission is to maintain the balance between human progress and the preservation of the marine ecosystem. As the ages progress, threats increase: pollution, overfishing, oil exploration... Will you guide humanity toward harmonious coexistence, or witness the destruction of the oceans?

Detailed Gameplay
1. Global Ocean Vision
The player views an oceanic map from a top-down perspective (pixel art style inspired by animated atlases).
Each era presents a section of the ocean (coral reefs, deep seas, coastal zones) with dynamic elements: fauna, flora, and human colonies.
The map evolves based on the player’s choices: an area may become a barren underwater desert or thrive with flourishing biodiversity.
2. Divine Roles and Mechanics
Your octopus possesses divine powers that evolve over time:

Preservation: Influence ocean currents, repair coral reefs, guide fish migrations.
Judgment: Punish humanity (storms, attacks by giant creatures) to curb their excesses.
Blessings: Aid humans respectful of nature (enhancing harvests, protecting against marine predators).
Each power consumes divine energy points, which you regain by maintaining a healthy balance in the ecosystem.

3. Progression Through the Ages
Prehistory: Humans live in harmony with nature. You must guide them to avoid overfishing key species. The stakes are minimal, but this sets the foundation for balance.
Antiquity: Navigation begins, with fishermen and small merchant fleets. Monitor the impact of their activities on coastal ecosystems.
Industrial Age: Steam-powered ships emerge, along with overfishing, coal spills, and early pollutants. Coral reefs face growing threats.
Modern Age: Oil platforms, industrial fishing, and plastic pollution jeopardize the entire ecosystem. Prevent total collapse.
Each era introduces new threats but also opportunities: some civilizations may adopt sustainable technologies (e.g., renewable energy) if guided properly.

Main Systems
1. Ecosystem Balance
The core of the game revolves around maintaining a delicate balance:

Marine ecosystems (fish, corals, algae, etc.) are interconnected: if one species disappears, others are affected (e.g., overfishing sardines causes harmful algae blooms).
Human actions (pollution, fishing) must be counterbalanced by your divine interventions.
Indicators to monitor:

Biodiversity: The number and health of species.
Pollution: Microplastics, oil spills, toxic waste.
Human satisfaction: Humans must have enough resources to thrive.
Failure in any indicator can lead to irreversible consequences (e.g., species extinction, dead zones in the ocean).

2. Evolving Divine Powers
Each age grants new powers:

Prehistory: Manipulate currents to redistribute fish.
Antiquity: Create storms to drive away ships.
Industrial Age: Clean up polluted zones.
Modern Age: Summon a mythical creature (e.g., Kraken) to destroy an oil platform.
Powers have moral implications: punishing humans may lower their satisfaction, while helping them encourages sustainable practices (or, sometimes, greater exploitation).

3. Emergent Narratives
A subtle story unfolds based on your actions. For example: guiding a human civilization to adopt ecological practices unlocks specific dialogues or events.
Certain decisions can have long-term effects across ages (e.g., an imbalance caused in Antiquity may make the Modern Age more challenging).

Aesthetic and Ambiance
Pixel Art Style: Vibrant and detailed. The ocean’s color palette shifts depending on the era and the ecosystem’s state (e.g., vibrant and lively in prehistory, dark and polluted in the modern era).
Immersive Soundtrack: Calming and adaptive music with aquatic instruments (e.g., harp, soft synths).
Challenges and Replayability
Each playthrough could feature different map configurations and events.
A moral choice system: each era presents dilemmas (e.g., sacrificing one species to save another).
Multiple endings: a healthy, balanced ocean, a post-apocalyptic world, or a fragile compromise.
